Start with WHY you're teaching (or leading)
%
Before diving into any role, figure out what unique voice you bring. Your 'why' becomes your compass when everything else feels uncertain.
%
Yes, AND... builds scenes (and solutions)
%
Instead of shutting down ideas, build on them. Even if the initial suggestion isn't perfect, there's usually something valuable to work with.
%
The 5-second rule beats overthinking
%
When you're stuck or hesitating, count down from 5 and take action. Your body often knows what to do before your brain catches up.
%
Intention vs Impact - we judge ourselves by intentions, others by impact
%
When conflicts arise, focus on behaviors and outcomes, not character judgments. Ask 'What was your intention?' and 'What was the actual impact?'
%
Comfortable with silence creates space for magic
%
Not every pause needs to be filled. Sometimes the most powerful moment is letting others process, think, or respond in their own time.
%
Trust is built through action, not just words
%
Sometimes you build confidence by doing the thing you're scared of, not by thinking about it more. Success creates trust in yourself and others.
%
Set clear expectations to create safety
%
Boundaries aren't restrictions - they're the container that allows creativity and risk-taking to flourish safely.
%
Ask WHY five times to get to the real issue
%
Surface-level problems usually have deeper roots. Keep asking 'why' until you uncover what's really going on.
%
Focus on goals vs objectives - destination vs steps
%
Goals are where you want to end up. Objectives are measurable steps to get there. You need both, but they serve different purposes.
%
Learning happens in six stages - meet people where they are
%
People learn at different paces and in different ways. Your job isn't to rush them through stages, but to meet them where they are right now.
%
Differentiate your notes - one size doesn't fit all
%
What someone needs to hear depends on their experience level, goals, and current challenges. Customize your feedback and guidance.
%
Side-coach in real-time instead of waiting
%
If you can help someone course-correct in the moment, do it. Waiting until later often means the learning opportunity is lost.
%
Make the invisible work visible
%
People can't appreciate or account for work they can't see. Document processes, celebrate behind-the-scenes efforts, and share your thinking.
%
Feedforward beats feedback - focus on what's next
%
Instead of dwelling on what went wrong, focus on what can be adjusted going forward. Growth happens in the future, not the past.
%
Students don't take notes when they're not ready - timing matters
%
You can give the perfect advice, but if someone isn't ready to receive it, it won't land. That's not about you - it's about timing.
%
Watch shows to learn - be a student of your craft
%
You can't improve in isolation. Observe others who do what you want to do well. Make learning from others a regular practice.
%
Trust the process when you don't know the outcome
%
Sometimes you have to start moving before you can see the whole path. Trust that each step will reveal the next one.
%
Bad ideas often contain good ones - don't dismiss too quickly
%
The worst suggestions sometimes spark the best solutions. Create space for terrible ideas - they often lead somewhere unexpected.
%
Debrief with specific questions, not general feelings
%
Instead of asking 'How did that go?' ask targeted questions that help people reflect on specific aspects of their performance.
%
Being 'good enough' is often better than being perfect
%
Done and shared beats perfect and hidden. You learn more from putting imperfect work into the world than from perfecting it in isolation.
%
Lead people to success right now, not notes after
%
Help someone course-correct in the moment rather than cataloging everything they did wrong for later.
%
Don't try to brand yourself - just do good work
%
Rather than trying to differentiate with fancy new takes on everything, keep it simple and focus on doing the work well.
%
Your failure is a gift to the group
%
When you mess up, you're giving everyone else a learning opportunity. Thank yourself for being the martyr for a moment.
%
It's going to be okay
%
Simple mantra. Most things that feel catastrophic in the moment work out.
%
Put your blinders on and run your own race
%
Stop comparing yourself to others. Their path isn't yours.
%
Your job is to listen, not defend
%
When receiving feedback, resist the urge to deflect, justify, or explain. Just listen. The note is yours whether you agree with it or not.
%
The day I stop learning is the day I start dying
%
Never assume you've figured it out. Keep being a student.
%
Underneath all cultural differences, there's just people
%
Universal human experiences - falling in love, arguing with parents, first dates - bind us all.
%
If your gut says something's wrong, address it
%
Trust your instincts. If you sense discomfort or weird energy, name it and deal with it rather than hoping it goes away.
%
Doing is learning - talking about it is not
%
At some point you have to stop discussing and start doing. That's where the real learning happens.
